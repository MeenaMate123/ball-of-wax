<p>11. Mary-Anne McTrowe - Present Joys</p>
<p>“PRAISE LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. PRESENT JOYS PASSING FAST. HEAVEN AT LAST”<br>
My piece is a fragment of the sacred harp song “Present Joys.” I wanted to try to saturate the song with itself, without straying from the original melody or basic structure. It ended up being a fairly simple process- I sang the tenor, alto, and treble parts of the first section of the song each three times, staggered them as though the song was a round, and then applied a panning echo filter.</p>
