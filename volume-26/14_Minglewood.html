<p>14. Chicken Tractor Deluxe - Minglewood Blues<br>
“NEVER LET ONE WOMAN RULE MIND, KEEP YOU WORRIED, TROUBLED ALL TIME. MARRIED WOMAN SEES ME SOMETIMES. GOT LETTER YOU OUGHT TO READ, YOU COMING SEE ME KNOCK ME ON HEAD”<br>
Jimmy James Baughman: vocals and upright bass; Nell Hanssen: acoustic guitar; Gary Gyekis: drums; Dave Mudgett: electric guitar; Kai Schafft: distorted acoustic guitar and siren whistle.
This is our remake of the tune done by Cannon’s Jug Stompers on Volume 3 of the Anthology: A shit wagon with no brakes barreling down the mountain. From our 2011 album, Nightclub Jacks and Undertakers, and one of the many songs we’ve covered off the Anthology.</p>
