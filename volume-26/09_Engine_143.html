<p>9. The Way It Is - Engine 143</p>
<p>“GEORGIE RUNS INTO ROCK AFTER MOTHER’S WARNING. DIES WITH THE ENGINE HE LOVES”<br>
Michael R. Sanchez: Microphone, drums & programming<br>
Recorded in Chicago on 9/30/2011.<br>
This song, first popularized by the Carter Family, was the only song on The Anthology of American Folk Music that truly spoke to me. I’m keen on the sentiments of the story, as well as the vocal melody, and soon found myself researching its history (based on true events!) and listening to renditions by other artists like Johnny Cash and Joan Baez, whose especially emotive interpretation was my favorite.</p>
