<p>5. Nate Biehl & Caroline Keys - My Name Is John Johanna</p>
<p>“DITCH DIGGER SHOCKED BY EMPLOYMENT AGENTS’ GROTESQUE DECEPTIONS”<br>
Nate Biehl and Caroline Keys recorded John Johanna in a garage in Missoula, Montana on an organ that was given to Nate, a banjo that came to Caroline when her Subaru was totaled last winter, and an electric guitar that Nate bought from an 11-year-old boy for $70. It was the whistling and “walking skeletons” that drew the two to this song. Biehl and Keys have collaborated for nearly a decade in Broken Valley Roadshow. Caroline also plays in Stellarondo, Nate in Cash for Junkers.</p>
