<p>1. Virgin of the Birds - Fatal Flower Garden</p>
<p>“GAUDY WOMAN LURES CHILD FROM PLAYFELLOWS; STABS HIM AS VICTIM DICTATES MESSAGE TO PARENTS”<br>
Recorded and performed by Virgin of the Birds. Virgin of the Birds is Jon Rooney.<br>
With “Fatal Flower Garden” I tried to make it sound as far from folk or Americana as possible, thus the electric guitars, distorted synthesizers and general fuzziness.</p>
