<p>2. Led to Sea - Say What You Will</p>
<p>Inspired by Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Pale Fire</i></p>
<p>oh say what you will<br>
I have his full attention<br>
oh laugh at the thing<br>
that you don’t understand<br>
I’ll fill him with detail<br>
of the life I left behind<br>
he’ll retell the story<br>
of the kingdom that was mine<br>
<br>
watch the light there in the window<br>
he’s working into night<br>
maybe he thinks of me<br>
while I crouch here in the darkness<br>
hoping for a sign<br>
that he will write for me<br>
what will he write for me?<br>
<br>
oh say what you will<br>
he believes every detail<br>
of the cherished land,<br>
where I once reigned as King<br>
he knows all its secrets<br>
through the genius of my mind<br>
you’ve no hope to conceive<br>
of its majesty sublime<br>
<br>
stash the tome deep in the closet<br>
his body on the ground<br>
what did he write of me?<br>
I steal a glance at tiny pages<br>
and can’t believe my eyes<br>
he did not write of me<br>
he did not write for me<br>
<br>
oh say what you will<br>
now I have your full attention<br>
what I have in my hands<br>
you won’t understand<br>
till I retell his story<br>
as it filters through my mind<br>
interpret each sonnet<br>
make it represent my kind<br>
<br>
flee my home, all vicious rumour<br>
the second time this life<br>
and he did not write of me<br>
crouching cold, this cave of darkness<br>
reshape words to mine<br>
I’ll make him write for me<br>
yes, he shall write for me<br>
yes he will write of me</p>
