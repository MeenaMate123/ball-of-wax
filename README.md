* Add jPlayer (http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/)
* "Database" will be a set of zip files you email me with:

    volume-1 (folder)
        volume-1.json (text file)
        fatalflowergarden.mp3
        thebutchersboy.mp3
        fatalflowergarden.jpg
        thebutchersboy.jpg
        fatalflowergarden.html
        thebutchersboy.html

So the zip file has a special text file named ".json", a bunch of mp3s, a bunch of images, and a bunch of "html" files that are just partial html, don't worry about all the head and body tags, just write what you want and it would be plopped into a page.

Example: fatalflowergarden.html

    <img src="fatalflowergarden.jpg" />
    <p><strong>Virgin of the Birds<strong> brings us a great rendition of <em>Fatal Flower Garden</em>.</p>
    <p>This classic song...</p>

The json file is less flexible... and has most of the information about the volume.

Example volume-1.json
